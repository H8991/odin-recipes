    <ul>
        <li>Mixed greens: (e.g., lettuce, spinach, spring mix)</li>
        <li>Vegetables: (e.g., cherry tomatoes, cucumber, bell peppers, carrots)</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Greens:

Wash and thoroughly dry your mixed greens. This is crucial for the dressing to stick properly. You can use a salad spinner or pat them dry with paper towels.
Tear or chop larger leaves into bite-sized pieces if needed.</li>
        <li>Chop the Vegetables:
Wash and chop your chosen vegetables (e.g., halve cherry tomatoes, slice cucumber, dice bell peppers, grate carrots). Keep the pieces relatively uniform in size for easier eating.</li>
        <li>Combine Ingredients:
Place the prepared greens and chopped vegetables in a large salad bowl.</li>
        <li>Make the Dressing:
In a small bowl or jar, whisk together olive oil, vinegar (such as balsamic or red wine vinegar), salt, and pepper. Add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice if desired. Taste and adjust seasonings.</li>
        <li>Dress and Toss:
Just before serving, drizzle the dressing over the salad ingredients.
Gently toss the salad using tongs or your hands until everything is evenly coated. Be careful not to over-dress it.</li>
        <li>Serve Immediately:
Serve your fresh, simple salad right away.</li>
